Information Gathered:
- The project is a Flask-based medication reminder system with user authentication, profile management, prescription image OCR extraction, AI-based text transformation, and WhatsApp medication reminders.
- OCR extraction uses EasyOCR and Google Gemini API for transforming prescription text into structured JSON.
- Medication reminders are sent via WhatsApp using pywhatkit with formatted messages and scheduled times.
- System and workflow diagrams are available as medication_reminder_diagram.png and medication_reminder_workflow_diagram.png.
- The project uses SQLite for data storage and has a modular structure.
